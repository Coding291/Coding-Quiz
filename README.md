# Coding-Quiz

* To create a multiple choice coding quiz, we first created a div element in HTML file and gave it some ID that would later be grabbed onto JavaScript.

* We created a main function and inside of that function we created several element and using methods like .createElement and .appendChild we created several items. We also used properties like .textContent and .innerHTML to grab the HTML file and get them applied to JavaScript

* We then created a function that would tell once the game is over what should happen. We created another function for timer so when the timer starts running from 60 downwards how would it effect the overall code. 

* We then called each of the function inside an if statment which was created based on the variable aissgned to the queryselector which select the start game id from HTML and where it really all begins
